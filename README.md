# Model Development Journey: Stock Prediction Challenge

## Phase 1: Identifying the Challenge of Class Imbalance

In the first phase, we recognized a common hurdle in machine learning: class imbalance. Our dataset exhibited a significant disproportion, with an overwhelming majority of instances in one class. This led to our models excelling at predicting the majority class while struggling with the minority class, as evidenced by the low precision and recall for the latter.

### Addressing Imbalance
To counteract this imbalance, we explored several strategies:
- **Resampling Techniques**: Balancing the dataset by either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class.
- **Weighted Classes**: Adjusting the models to give higher importance to the minority class.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Utilizing SMOTE for generating synthetic samples of the minority class.

## Phase 2: Refining the Gradient Boosting Classifier

Upon refining the Gradient Boosting Classifier, we observed a substantial improvement in recall for the minority class. However, this gain in recall came with a reduction in precision for the same class and a slight drop in overall accuracy.

### Insights
- **Trade-off Between Precision and Recall**: An increased ability to identify the best-performing stocks was offset by a higher rate of false positives.
- **Macro Average F1-Score**: Despite these adjustments, the overall balance between precision and recall, as measured by the macro average F1-score, showed little improvement.

### Moving Forward
We proposed several steps for further enhancement:
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Fine-tuning the model's decision threshold.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Re-evaluating and enhancing the features used for training.
- **Model Complexity**: Experimenting with more complex configurations of the Gradient Boosting model.

## Phase 3: Tweaking Decision Thresholds

Adjustments to decision thresholds revealed interesting shifts:
- **Increased Precision for Class 1**: A reduction in false positives.
- **Decreased Recall for Class 1**: A lower rate of correctly identifying all true best performers.
- **Improved Precision for Class 0**: Maintaining high precision for the majority class.

### Interpretation
- **Balanced Model**: We achieved a more balanced model in terms of precision and recall for the minority class.
- **Macro Average F1-Score Improvement**: Notable enhancement in the overall balance of the model.

## Enhancing the LSTM Model

We then shifted our focus to the LSTM model, aiming for a more advanced and robust architecture.

### Key Strategies
1. **Advanced LSTM Architecture**: Introducing more layers, implementing dropout, and utilizing Bidirectional LSTM.
2. **Data Preparation Enhancements**: Incorporating longer time steps and more relevant features.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting units in LSTM layers, learning rate, and experimenting with batch sizes and epochs.

Despite these efforts, the LSTM model still faced challenges in accurately predicting the minority class, mirroring issues observed in other classifiers.

## Phase 4: LSTM Model Adjustments with Class Weights

Adjusting the LSTM model with class weights led to remarkable changes:
- **Significantly Improved Recall for Class 1**: Successfully identifying minority class instances.
- **Low Precision for Class 1**: Continued challenges with a high rate of false positives.
- **Reduced Overall Accuracy**: A decrease in the model's accuracy due to these adjustments.

## Phase 5: Threshold Experimentation with LSTM

In our final phase, we experimented with various thresholds for the LSTM model, seeking an optimal balance:

- **Threshold Variations**: Testing at 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 showed different impacts on precision and recall.
- **Precision-Recall Trade-Off**: Highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing these two metrics.
- **Threshold Selection**: Emphasizing the importance of choosing an appropriate threshold based on specific application needs.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Complexity

Our journey through the development of this stock prediction model was marked by continuous learning and adaptation. Each phase brought new insights, emphasizing the intricate balance between precision and recall in machine learning, especially in the realm of class-imbalanced datasets.

As we conclude this chapter, we look forward to applying these valuable learnings to future challenges, ever mindful of the nuanced decisions and strategies that drive success in
